This repository will host the board files for the SHA2017 badge. There are a couple different revisions:
* _rev0_0_1_: First dev board
* _rev0_0_2_: First dev board with fixed IO error (not produced)
* _rev0_1_0_: "Pre-badge"
* _rev1_0_0_: Badge design (final, hopefully)

The badge was designed in Eagle version 6.6.
